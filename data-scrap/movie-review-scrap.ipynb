      "Review 1: For younger viewers, they might not understand the impact of \"Shrek\" on the film industry and CGI movies. However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film's appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn't quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.I could easily say more but this film has over a thousand reviews....so I'll just end it here!\n",
      "Review 2: Shrek is a wonderful parody of every fairytale story that you can think of, for the kids it has charm, humour and tons of fun, and is a delightful film for them to enjoy. In addition, Shrek has plenty of subtle innuendo and more adult themes running seamlessly along side the story, much of which may pass younger children by, without spoiling any element of their enjoyment; while at the same time enhancing the enjoyment for the older viewers.Shrek is simply so well created that it can successfully appeal to a huge audience excellently voiced as it is, by Mike Myers, John Lithgow, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy.Brilliant characters, solid script and hilarious parody, make this film a simply wonderful achievement, and that's without mentioning the awesome computer generated world that houses it.9/10\n",
      "Review 3: Shrek is a green ogre who lives in a swamp, but his king sends him on a mission which he must complete to get his own land back.You only have to watch ten minutes of this film to realise that this is going to be a classic. Eddie Murphy being employed as a wisecracking donkey was a casting dream and plays well against the more plain Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers. Ok the plot is old, new, borrowed and blue (all recaps and references to fairy tales), but I don't care. It is all so much good fun and better than that, the kind of thing that can be enjoyed by young and old, male or female. It is really a dream of movie and some brilliant pop tunes are employed that really work fantastically against the images. Real tear-to-the-eye stuff.A real bliss-out of a movie and all parties should be congratulated for making it so great. A real DVD buyer, because it can be enjoyed over and over again. Bring on the follow up, I can't wait.\n",
      "Review 4: Shrek is completely new.  Never has a fully CGI movie taken on the twists, turns, and surprises as Shrek has.  It's a full parody of numerous fairytales, and its humor is, well, humor at its best.  Grown men will laugh at the jokes of Farquaad's Stature and the hidden meaning behind every little comment.  Of course Shrek, like all other movies, has its emotional moments (so what if I lied about it being completely new?).  And these moments aren't cheesy or anything.  They are kind of funny, but at the time of viewing you won't really feel like laughing.  You'll feel like the characters.Like its CGI, Shrek has taken a new dimension.  It stretches out.  You're in the movie.  No, wait, you're watching a movie.  It's so hard to tell.  The characters are so real, so lifelike, it makes you feel you're there.  The environments are realistic, yet still animated.  The wind whispers through the grasslands and the characters' hair; the lightning and clouds are really there... aren't they?I was stunned and absorbed in this movie.  And unlike other movies, it has more than just CGI.  It's actually got a plot.  And what a plot it's got! This one is totally new.  Shrek is ordered to rescue a princess from the fiery keep guarded by a dragon in order to clear out his swamp of the menacing fairytale creatures.But it doesn't stop there.  The movie is full of surprises and stretches on further into what actually happens after.  The dialogue demands your attention throughout the movie, and then the dragon comes in.  Whenever you see the dragon, you'll know good things are bound to happen (but not necessarily for the characters in the movie).  The dragon is a comic relief, but still provides most of the action in the movie.  She chases Donkey and Shrek through the keep, she flies to help rescue Fiona from a despicable marriage, and she even has the satisfaction of swallowing a midget.Now some disputes have arisen about certain things.  But I must say what I always say:  this is only a movie, and it has no deeper meaning (despite the parodies).  Take it as it is.  There can be nothing offensive from Shrek unless you have something against overthrowing tyrants and good-natured humor.I must take a moment to speak about Donkey.  He is, and always will be, one of my most favorite characters in the world of movies.  Eddie Murphy was, no doubt, the perfect actor for him.  He is so funny, so unique, and so... fluffy.  What a perfect donkey!  His design is flawless and his dialogue perfect.  I can find nothing bad about this character.Shrek is perfect for everybody to see.  The little ones will love the vivid colors and lush landscapes.  The adults will enjoy this as well as the intelligent humor and deep plot.  And no one could dislike the arrangement of songs.  They fit really nice into the movie.  Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell's composed music is impressive (especially the theme for Escape from the Dragon).Shrek is brilliant moviemaking.  With a groundbreaking DVD, an all-star cast, great music, excellent graphics, and a great parodized yet original plot and storyline, Shrek is no doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen.\n",
      "Review 5: A movie suitable for children, but really made for an adult audience. It's funny, has many quotable catchphrases and teaches us so much. It shows us that love has no limits, that you can find love where you'd least expect it and that beauty doesn't show only on the outside. It is also a great story about unlikely characters forming friendships that will last a lifetime.\n",
      "Review 6: Shrek is one hell of an animated ride, and right when you're certain you know where to expect the next gag it one ups you. If you need a reason to see Shrek, here is that reason: imagine Eddie Murphy as an annoying not to mention obnoxious talking donkey. Yeah. Eddie Murphy gives Robin Williams a serious run for his money in terms of greatest animated side kick. From there we get Mike Myers voicing a big green ogre, who plays off Eddie Murphy with perfect comedic timing like the two were meant to do this film together. Shrek is merciless in its humor. Targeting everything from fairy tales to Disney films to narrative clichés to bad puns, sliding in its own commentary, all the while giving the typical fantasy story a few modern twists and turns to deliver a strangely original unoriginal story with original unoriginal characters . . . that doesn't make sense, but Shrek does, does it well, and doesn't care. And you never know where this humor is going to come from, either  either visual gag, musical nod, or spoken dialogue. All three provide their share of narrative and commentary to the concepts in Shrek. I think the beauty of Shrek is it's taken the typical fairy tale (which all of us have heard), and it answers the silly 'what if . . .' and 'why don't they ever . . .' questions we tend to ask. But that's not the core of the story - the core of this story is the friendship between Shrek and Donkey, which works in a funny goofball, but touching and unique way. If the audience can buy into Shrek and Donkey's relationship to one another, then they can believe entire film (which more or less focuses on the adventure the two share together). True, Shrek has a love theme . . . but it's Donkey and Shrek who sustain the film through most of the picture. As for Cameran Diaz and John Lithgow, while not on screen as much as our two heroes, still play an important role. I wouldn't want to downplay Lithgow and Diaz who do bring their respective characters to life, but Shrek is a tale about an enduring friendship with a romance story on the side.\n",
      "Review 7: The Simpsons has been one of my favorite TV shows, and for the same reason that I like the Simpsons is what makes Shrek so good. The Simpsons takes the children-only medium of cartoons and makes an adult show out of it, with jokes in it that only adults will find amusing, some for adult eyes' only. Shrek is animation, a beautiful computer animation that looks realistic and bold, has enough kiddy humor in it to make the kids like it, but has even more jokes that adults will love. It's the cross between childhood innocence and adult knowledge that brings Shrek so many laughs. Mike Myers supplies the voice of Shrek, an ogre who enjoys living by himself in his swamp on the outskirt of Duloc, a near-perfect kingdom ran by the insecure Lord Farquaad, voice with wonderful swarmy-ness by John Lithgow. When Farquaad begins to deposit all of the mythical creatures that populate his kingdom into Shrek's swamp, Shrek demands to see the king, and only the smart-ass Donkey knows the way. Donkey is a sassy talking, well, donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy and is the Lou Costello to Shrek's Bud Abbot--to say Shrek is the straight man in this odd couple is an understatement. After meeting the king, Shrek and Donkey then have a quest of finding Fraquaad Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an imprisoned lady guarded by a dragon. I personally would have gone with Snow White, but to each their own. What also sets Shrek apart from other animated movies is the music, mostly rock music, mostly from Smashmouth. I do not think a Disney picture would have made the same selections. It gives it a different feel from the usual animated fare, Shrek for sure has it's own identity. Getting back to the animation, the computer generated scenery and characters are great to look at, very lifelike, even the human beings. Pixar, who has made films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, has made it clear that human beings are the most difficult objects to animate on computers, but I think DreamWorks got it right in Shrek--there is nothing there that makes me say \"that does not look right.\" There are great in-jokes about the world of childhood stories, while sprinkling in some very adult humor. The best sight gags for me revolve around Farquaad interrogating a gingerbread man and threatening a magic mirror. Shrek will entertain and amuse the young and old alike.\n",
      "Review 8: \"Shrek\" is fun. People who haven't seen this movie, and are wary of seeing what's popular, should give it a try. It's worth watching, and will probably win you over.Taking a Fractured Fairy Tale approach to a \"Beauty And The Beast\"-type plot, throwing in a few mild profanities, flatulence jokes, and Michael Myers' over-the-top faux-Scots accent, \"Shrek\" shows off a very snarky humor, full of jokes that will likely go over the heads of a cartoon's target audience while registering with their parents. 'Sure it's big enough, but look at the location,' Shrek observes upon seeing a giant castle in the middle of nowhere. The kids, though, will love 'Shrek' every bit as much. It's impossible not to be carried along by its merry madness.Myers, as the title character, is certainly easier to take than he was in his last Austin Powers movie, his voice work registering real tenderness as well as the expected laughs as a misunderstood ogre who would rather tell a group of frightened villagers about the cruelties he will inflict on them and their dead bodies than cause those villagers any genuine harm. He's a bit of a softie, actually, and scared to let anyone know it.Cameron Diaz is as beautiful to listen to hear as she is to look at in her other films. Her character, Princess Fiona, doesn't have as much room to shine as Shrek (the balance turns out better in the sequel) but she does well with what she's given.The comic highpoints in terms of voice characterization is Eddie Murphy as Shrek's donkey companion and John Lithgow as nasty Lord Farquaad, who wants to rid his domain of Duloc of all fairy tale creatures. Murphy never stops being funny even as he helps set up key plot moments; in fact he's never been this funny since the first \"Beverly Hills Cop\" movie. \"We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles,\" the donkey tells a much put-upon Shrek, and you still laugh the fifth time you hear it. Lithgow just makes you smile whenever he opens his mouth, like when he grills a hapless gingerbread man in such a convoluted way it turns into a nursery-rhyme recitation.Why exactly Farquaad is grilling this gingerbread man so closely isn't clear, and there are similar plot holes throughout the movie. Shrek may be too tame a character; we never really feel any worry around him. The donkey falls into a relationship with a dragon that screams \"plot convenience,\" and there are strange little bits of cruelty, like turning a frog and snake into balloons, which just is thrown out there and let be.But the central story, about how Shrek and Fiona struggle to overcome the odds and find true love, is really sweet and well-rendered. The animation is spectacular, a revolution for the eyes in its deep-dish panoramas and remarkable attention to textures. And the jokes keep flying, the major ones as well as hilarious bits of filigree you won't notice the first or second time but reward you for paying attention.This is not a Disney movie, something \"Shrek\" makes very clear not only with its PG-13 humor but its knocks at Disney characters like Snow White and at the Magic Kingdom in the form of Duloc, where an array of \"It's A Small World\"-type dolls lecture Shrek and Donkey on all the things NOT to do. Frankly, \"Shrek\" could use a little injection of Disney heart, but Disney could use some of this picture's freshness as well. A very charming movie worth your time.\n",
      "Review 9: I want this on video so I can watch parts of it selectively. The story is fun, the animation sensational, but seeing it only once in a theater didn't allow me time to scope out all the sight gags. I loved the background images, the schtick that Shrek does because he is an ogre and as gross as they come. But it went by so fast. Since I saw a stage version of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, I have thoroughly enjoyed films and plays that have a bunch of significant action going on around the characters that are currently being focused on. The \"real\" plot, so to speak. The fairy tale world that is the setting of this animated joy, is what I really want to see. These characters, who are parts of lots of little stories, go about their daily business, running from big bad wolves or being left to follow bread crumbs. Meanwhile Shrek, being a kind ogre, must put up with the constant pleas of the fairy tale populace, who make nuisances of themselves.Eddie Murphy's donkey, of course, is the most soul testing of them all with his excessive verbiage and quick wit. Nothing ever enters his brain without immediately going to his mouth. This is a fun film, and even if it does go for bathroom humor, it done with great aplomb!\n",
      "Review 10: Shrek was creative, innovative, funny, and special. Someone had to give the ogres' point of view and there needed to be a princess image other than the perfect image we always see.Every princess is a precious, beautiful darling. If she's not, then she's unbearable. Shrek gives us a hero that is ugly and repulsive on the outside but gentle and caring on the inside. It also gives us a princess that doesn't fit the prototypical mold. It is a splendid animation that warms the heart.\n",
      "Review 11: I liked the incidental music very much, especially in the escape from the Dragon scene. I wasn't hugely fond of the pop music featured, but putting that minor quibble aside, this was still an original and funny animated film, that will please any animation lover. The animation is faultless, never stiff, and lovely backgrounds. The script is laugh-out-loud funny with the fairytale characters, Gingerbread Man especially, and Robin Hood. The characters are definitely memorable, and the terrific voice cast brings the film to life. Mike Myers voices the ogre with feeling, but it is Eddie Murphy who steals the film. Though Cameron Diaz is lovely as Fiona, and John Lithgow is delightfully villainous as Lord Farquad, though his villain isn't the most memorable villain ever in an animation. The film sparkles with heart and humour, it is impossible not to like it. In conclusion, look out for it, you'll be glad you did! 9/10 Bethany Cox.\n",
      "Review 12: Shrek (Mike Myers) is a green ogre happily living alone. Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has rounded up all of the kingdom's magical creatures into Shrek's swamp. Shrek wants his isolation back. It doesn't help that he is now followed by the talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Farquaad wants to have Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so that he could be a proper king. So Farquaad strikes a deal with Shrek. If Shrek rescues Fiona, Farquaad will return Shrek his swamp.This is simply a super fun family movie. Shrek is an unconventional hero, and Fiona is an unconventional damsel in distress. It turns some of the superficial aspects of fairy tales on its head without straying from the emotional truths. In the end, they are all about finding true love. And this movie is a reminder of a funny Eddie Murphy that is too often missing in his recent movies.\n",
      "Review 13: A grumpy ogre who lives alone in his swamp finds out that a mean lord has exiled dozens of fairytale creatures to his swamp. In order to get them out of there, he must make a deal with the lord to rescue a princess in the highest room of the tallest tower guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Aided by a fast-talking donkey, the two set off on a quest and get his swamp back in time.I remember seeing this movie when it was on video and I enjoyed every moment of it. 20 years later, it has aged very well. The characters are likeable especially Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona (who all share some great chemistry together) while Lord Farquaad makes for a very good villain. Yes the story does have the misunderstanding cliche we've seen in dozens of movies, but it does something unique like giving some depth to Fiona and the reason to her ugly form. Shrek also gets some character depth as the film explains the reason why the ogre is feared by many people. Not to mention that it does a subtle job in it's satire of fairytales with some of the most hilarious moments. The voice work is great especially with Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow, the animation is superb especially the look of Shrek's swamp, the dragon's keep, Lord Farquaad's castle, etc., and the music score from both John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams is both haunting and magical.Overall, Shrek still holds up after 20 long years. To those who haven't seen the film yet, check it out. :)\n",
      "Review 14: I'm not one of those persons who praises \"Shrek\" all the time as one of the greatest movies ever made, like many other persons seem to do. Quite frankly I never really understood what the hype was all about. But still you have to give credit to this movie, it's very entertaining and fun to watch over and over again.A good sidekick is always important, especially in an animated movie. A good sidekick can make the movie better but a bad sidekick can really ruin a movie. \"Shrek\" doesn't have a good sidekick...it has an excellent sidekick! Donkey is a wonderful and entertaining character thanks to Eddie Murphy who voiced him. The other main voices are provided by Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow.Further more I would like to add that I absolutely love the character Pinocchio in this movie.The story is told in a good way with a nice pace, I especially like how subtle some Disney movies and characters are spoofed. But for some reason I never really found the story in general that very appealing.The movie is well animated and it shows that DreamWorks is a worthy competitor for Pixar.The music is good and takes the movie to an higher level and I'm not just talking about the evergreen songs but also about the movie soundtrack by John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams who know how to compose a good and fun score for animated movies.Although it's getting more credit than it really deserves, it's still a fun and entertaining animated movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\n",
      "Review 15: This most assuredly is not a perfect film, but it is a marvelous send-up of the fairy-tale genre and the script is great.  This has romance, humor, a talking donkey, no car chases and makes fun of The Mouse.  What more could you ask for?  Movie spoofs and karaoke?  It has those too.  Most harrowing performance by gingerbread?  You betcha!  The voicework is spot on and even Eddie Murphy is enjoyable.  Great fun is had by all (except Michael Eisner-I'd love to have been a fly on the wall in Eisner's office the morning after this copped the Oscar for Animated Feature).  Very entertaining and well worth your time.  Most recommended.\n",
      "Review 16: Everything about 'Shrek' has probably already been said but here's my little comment. 'Shrek' is definitely one of the most enjoyable flicks. There has been tremendous work put in the animation process. Yet, the makers haven't given the screenplay any less considerations and we are told a heartwarming but relevant story. Though the characters of Shrek, Fiona and Donkey are original (maybe Donkey is from the Musicians of Bremen?), we also meet various fairy tale characters spoofed into the screenplay providing us several hilarious moments.Among the voice talents, Eddie Murphy steals the show with his loud, expressive and vivacious voice. He also gets the best lines. No wonder Donkey remains the favorite character. Mike Myers is adequate. However, he doesn't seem to get the accent right all the time. Cameron Diaz is good and John Lithgow does his part very well.I consider the soundtrack a must-buy. It boasts of a compilation of famous song that fairly contribute to the screenplay as background score. The writers deserve more credit for providing those memorable hilarious moments such as Fiona singing with the bird, Donkey and Dragon's affair, the snake and frog balloons and numerous other sketches.However, on the downside, there are a few plot holes e.g. Dragon's attraction towards Donkey isn't explained and why does Lord Farquaad torture the Gingerbread man? How would the Gingerbread man know about the others? Yet, the main plot of Fiona and Shrek mostly makes up for this flaw.Without any doubt, 'Shrek' is one of the best family flicks of recent time. Kids will love the colours and the fairy tale characters and grown-ups will love the witty dialogues and intelligent humour and most would love the story.\n",
      "Review 17: I'm an old dude, 75 to be exact, and in my working days I was everything from a mainframe programmer to a HiTech startup Tech Admin. This sentence is here only to show why I am interested in the productions of Dreamworks and, of course, Pixar. Coming from a computer background permits me to be very, very impressed with the wonderful skill and creativity that go into making movies such as Shreck.Now then: The movie itself is marvelous! The characters are gentle and funny; there is no gratuitous violence; there are innuendos, of course, but skillfully done in a way that the \"libretto\" if you will can be \"read\" at least two levels. The story line itself is charming, and the ending is a real, nifty surprise!I add here that I've watched this with my younger G_Kids, who loved it; and also with my bride of fifty years, who loved it.It is in all ways in a class with the best that Mr. Jobs has so far produced, which is saying a great deal.HIGHLY recommended as good, funny, charming entertainment for a whole bunch of ages.Nick Fortis Los Altos California\n",
      "Review 18: 9 OUT OF 10!!!! We went to catch the matinee preview of \"Shrek\". We were still giggling by the time we got home afterwards. Two hours later, we dragged a friend out and went back for the evening show. Some of the shock value was lost, but we caught a few of the background sight gags we missed the first time, and anticipation of some of the other scenes had us in tears before they even happened. Interesting to see the different audience reactions of different age groups, too. This is a *very* funny movie, but it should be noted that most of the kiddy humour is on the burp/fart and yucky dining habits level - Shrek is rather closely related to Raymond Briggs' Fungus the Bogeyman without the orange mohawk. The dialogue and main action quips are mainly aimed at adults and sophisticated kids. One little voice in the afternoon audience piping up \"WHAT's he compensating for?\" cracked me up...Be warned that this movie is a non-stop send-up of all things Disney. If predictability and saccharine is your cup of tea, you may not like it. On the other hand, if you are cynical about theme parks and like the idea of fairytale classics getting the Monty Python treatment, you'll love it. Every time a scene looks familiar, it means it is about to go pear-shaped. And it's not just old classics that get the treatment. I spotted (mis)quotes from films that are just being released, both Disney and non-Disney. You name it, it gets an affectionate pie in the face at some point in \"Shrek\".As a fairytale, however offbeat, \"Shrek\" is tighter plotted and better characterised than most Hollywood dross.The parodic twists, a love story subplot that owes more to Shakespeare's comedies than fairytale formula, and the \"ugly is the new beautiful\" Message more than make up for the derivativeness due to extensive quotation.As for the acting, confinement to voice-overs keeps the egos of Myers and Murphy in check, and they do a fantastic job as the big fat green smelly recluse and the obnoxiously manic donkey respectively. Diaz is great as a feisty princess who reminds me of Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy crossed with Lara Croft. Lithgow's Farquaad is a wonderful Bad Guy, modelled on Olivier's Richard III apart from his Little Problem being different. And the Fairytale Creatures...excellent, all of them. The graphics, of course, are state of the art for at least another 2 weeks. We're talking freckles, skin pores and stubble, pupil dilation, and amazing light-and-shade. They had to tone down the realism of the humanoids to stop them looking creepily android-like.Highly recommended, except for overly precious schmalz addicts.\n",
      "Review 19: \"Shrek\" is a great little fun movie, with sharp,eye-popping computer animation and a knock-out Dolby Digital surround sound track. We have watched it a number of times since 2001.It is a story of a kind-hearted Ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) who just wants to be left alone in his swamp. A very animated talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) just wants to be friends with Shrek. Throw in a princess (voiced by Cameron Diaz) and a would-be king (voiced by John Lithgow) and the film takes fun to a new level. In what amounts to a very scrambled collection of famous cartoon characters (Three Pigs, Big Bad Wolf, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, etc) and techniques borrowed from movies like \"Matrix\" and \"Crouching Tiger\", the animation shows slow motion, martial artist suspended in air for a moment, etc.The script has a few slow parts, but overall is excellent, and we found ourselves either snickering or laughing out loud often. The film even has \"message\" with the creative ending, but 95% of it is just good, funny stuff. Many of the \"jokes\" will be missed by some of the younger generation, and on first viewing even many of the older crowd will miss some of the subtle references.Disk one of this 2-disk set has the movie plus a very interesting \"making-of\" special. Disk 2 has more stuff that I will get around to seeing one cold, rainy winter day. In my personal rating system, an animated film can get no higher than a \"9\" of 10. I rate \"Shrek\" a solid \"8\", which for me puts it in the same category as \"Toy Story 2\", \"A Bug's Life\", \"Chicken Run\", and \"Monsters, Inc.\" All of them are marvelous, fun movies that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages.\n",
      "Review 20: I don't know if we could live in this world right now if you have not seen Shrek. I wasn't sure if I'd make it, because at the time that Shrek came out, I refused to see it. I wasn't into the computer animation, so I refused to see it, not to mention all the hype annoyed me. You know when a movie is over advertised, and sometimes that drives you more away than closer? That was my situation, but I'm glad I finally decided to give Shrek a chance.Shrek is an ogre who is feared by all the town people and prefers living his life solo, but when a annoying talking Donkey drops into his life, Donkey just kinda puts himself into Shrek's life. But when a circus drops onto Shrek's swampy home, he goes to the king, the king promises him his home back if he can go get Princess Fiona, his future bride. Shrek and Donkey do so, but Shrek ends up falling for the beautiful princess, but she has some hidden secrets of her own that just might help their love for each other.I'd have to say that I really did enjoy Shrek, it was a very sweet story with some funny jokes and terrific animation. I loved the homages to certain pop culture moments, like the Matrix, as much as it's over used joke wise, it really worked for the film and for kids who were a little too young when the Matrix came out. It's a great family film and I'd recommend it very much.8/10\n",

      "Review 22: Shrek is an awesome movie! Based in the ordinary fairy tales,the main thing here is to break the rules and the enchantment of those stories and show it all in a different way; Why the prince needs to be so perfect? Why the princess needs to be so beautiful?Why they need to live in a perfect castle?Why can't the royals be problematic? All of these answers are more than answered in Shrek. By the way, this is a movie with lots of humor. :)So, be prepare to laugh. (Donkey is annoying, but the biggest part of the fun comes from him!)Ps: All the cast is great as well. I already know Eddie Murphy's and Mike's(Myers)abilities as comedians,but I could never imagine that Cameron Diaz could be so perfect to do Fiona! Her voice is really cute, and I really cannot imagine a better one for Fiona ,than Cameron Diaz 's voice!\n",
      "Review 23: This movie really confronts the problems with society, such as the opioid crisis, domestic abuse, and donkey mistreatment head-on. It was a great way to talk about these issues with my teenage son.\n",
      "Review 24: How dare you triflin a** b**** give this master piece a 7.8/10 rating. if you give this anything less than 9 stars, we can fight in the taco bell parking lot\n",
      "Review 25: This arrived into the animated film market like a breath of fresh air. It was the anti fairytale animated film, that was self referencing and turned the cliche genre on its head. The good news is this film has not dated and still entertains since release. I would've liked to see Chris Farley in the lead role, but sadly that wasn't meant to be. The cast are great, especially Murphy. Classic and showcase for what fresh idea's should be.\n"
